# Sweeps, Front End Engineer

## Assignment

Develop a page based on a mockup, using [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org/) + [Pug](https://pugjs.org/) + [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) + [BootstrapVue](https://bootstrap-vue.js.org/).

1. `git clone` this repository - it contains a pre-configured NuxtJS project with all the needed dependencies. Install the dependencies with `npm install` and start the project with `npm run dev`.
2. Implement the following design: https://dribbble.com/shots/8582722/attachments/846577?mode=media
3. Out of all the filters in the mockup, include only the "Email" and "Created". The rest should be completely ignored. Remove the "Apply" button too - do the filtering live.
4. The "Email" filter should allow filtering by "email contains" and "email starts with".
5. The "Created" filter should present a date picker that will filter the list to show only people who were created at the exact date.
6. Except for the filters, no other elements need to be functional.
7. Use `https://sweeps.ai/assignment.json` as your data source, include it in whatever way you see fits. Show only people who their `isActive` attribute is `true`.
8. For avatars, use https://robohash.org/ .
9. For icons, use whatever icon library you'd like.
10. The website doesn't need a special mobile view, but do make sure it doesn't break completely.
